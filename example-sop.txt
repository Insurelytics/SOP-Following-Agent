(Nick/Uhas System)
0. Purpose
Create a monthly content plan (12 or 18 videos) for a client using:
The client onboarding doc (their DNA, offers, target, tone)


The 10x10/comps sheet (the creators they want to look like)


Nick’s standard script format (two columns: “NOTES AND B-ROLL” on the left, “SCRIPT” on the right)


Nick’s prompting style (always “cross reference the onboarding + 10x10”)


Goal: get ChatGPT to do the thinking, and the employee just chooses and organizes.

1. Inputs You Must Have Before You Start
Employee should collect these 3 things first:
Client Onboarding Doc


Business name


Person on camera


Offers (paid/free)


Target audience / avatars


Brand goal (authority, movement, lead gen)


Topics to avoid


Signature frameworks (e.g. Daily Courage: Key Three, FACTS, SOUP)


10x10 / Comps List


5–10 accounts they want to emulate


Notes on why (tone, topic, delivery, authority, “real talk,” etc.)


Package Size


12 shorts / 18 shorts


This determines the ratio


If any of those are missing → don’t script yet.

2. Step 1: Generate the “Style Guide Ratio Doc”
Employee prompt to ChatGPT:
“You are helping me build a monthly content mix for a personal brand. Cross reference this onboarding doc [PASTE] with these market comps [PASTE]. The goal is to make them the authority in their niche but also human and movement-driven.
Please give me a content ratio in this exact format:
Key Takeaways
 [summary]
[CLIENT NAME] – 12-Video Monthly Content Ratio
 Content Style | % of Monthly Output | # of Videos (12 total) | Primary Purpose | Example Topics / Angles
Make sure styles include: Talking Head (authority), VO Storytelling, Tutorial/Framework, Vlog/Doc moments, Lists/Hacks, Text-on-Screen/Visual.”
ChatGPT should return something like what we built:
Talking Head 30%


VO 10%


Tutorial 15%


Vlog/Doc 15%


Lists/Hacks 15%


Text-on-Screen 15%


Employee check:
Do the example topics match the onboarding doc language? (e.g. “courage,” “fear is a storyteller,” “courage to love,” “courage to be wealthy”)


Do the examples look like the comps? (Mel Robbins = direct, Sahil Bloom = structured, Wallo = real talk)


If yes → move on.

3. Step 2: Ask for 8–10 High-Level Ideas for ONE Style at a Time
We always do this piece-by-piece. Start with Talking Head, because it is the spine.
Employee prompt:
“Great. Let’s start with the Talking Head bucket. Based on the onboarding and the comps, give me 10 Talking Head video ideas that:
speak to fear vs courage


tie to money/career/relationships


sound like something Mel Robbins / Brene Brown / Wallo would post


but stay in this client’s language (Daily Courage, courage is a muscle, fear is the lock).


No scripts yet, just titles and one-line angles.”
Your job: pick 1.

4. Step 3: Lock the Topic, Then Ask for Script in Nick Format
Once the user (you) says “let’s do number 2,” employee asks for the script in our standard 2-column format.
Employee prompt:
“Let’s write that as a script in our standard format.
Use this structure every time:
Key Information:
 Video Format: [talking head / tutorial / VO / text on screen]
 Inspiration Video: [give me a real IG link that’s close in style]
 Subtopic: [restate topic]
 Instructions: [how to film it, tone, framing]
NOTES AND B-ROLL (LEFT COLUMN) | SCRIPT (RIGHT COLUMN)
Keep it around 1:15–1:30.
 No emojis.
 No dashes in dialogue.
 Keep it conversational like Jonathan’s IG: https://www.instagram.com/iamdailycourage/reels/
 Remember: actions on the left, dialogue on the right.”
That’s the piece your employee kept forgetting — always 2 columns.

5. Step 4: Tighten Length / Tone (Nick’s Usual Revision)
You almost always say: “make it shorter,” “more conversational,” or “like 60% of this.”
So teach the employee to do a second pass prompt right away.
Employee prompt:
“Can you tighten that to about 60% of the length, keep the same two-column format, and make it flow more like one idea instead of 5 separate mini speeches? Same hook.”
This gets you to the 1:15 mark.

6. Step 5: Repeat for the Other Buckets
After Talking Head, the employee should cycle through the rest of the ratio.
Here are the prompts per bucket:
A. VO Storytelling
“Using the onboarding doc and the courage ethos, give me 3 VO storytelling concepts that show a real fear-to-courage moment. Make them reflective, human, and movement-aligned. Then I will pick one and you’ll write it in the same 2-column format we’ve been using, with B-roll on the left and VO on the right.”
Then: “Write VO Story #2 in the format.”

B. Tutorial / Framework Explainers
“Cross reference the onboarding doc with their signature frameworks (Key Three, FACTS, SOUP). Give me 5 tutorial-style videos that show this is practical, not just motivational. Make them like this inspiration: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNyQcYa3H69/
 Then I will pick one and you’ll write it in the 2-column format.”

C. Vlog / Documentary Moments
“Give me 3 vlog/doc moments that show Jonathan actually living this (courage challenge, calling someone, talking to strangers, day in the life on courage). These should not be long monologues — I want VO over B-roll like the Puerto Rico scripts we did.”

D. Lists / Hacks
“Give me 5 list-style videos (saveable, scroll-stopping) that teach courage through money, relationships, or career. Not motivational quotes. Actual ‘do this today.’ Then I will pick one and you’ll write it in the 2-column format.”

E. Text on Screen / Visual
“Give me 5 text-on-screen visual concepts, based on Daily Courage brand lines, that can be filmed as one continuous B-roll shot with no talking. Example inspiration: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN_wFsLDgKg/. Then I will pick one and you’ll write it with B-roll on the left and just the text and caption on the right.”

7. Step 6: Client Revision Pass (like we just did for Lifetime Insurance)
Sometimes the client says “we want this exact structure but for employee benefits.”
 Employee should then do this prompt:
“Take this script [PASTE ORIGINAL] and rewrite it so the core idea is about [new topic, ex: employee benefits, annuities, P&C].
 Keep the format, tone, and length the same.
 Keep it in 2 columns.
 Add one line examples in each list item so the client knows how to explain it.”
That’s what we just did.

8. Step 7: Always Cross-Reference
This is the line your employee should use in almost every prompt:
“Cross reference the onboarding doc and the market comps so the topics stay in brand voice.”
That keeps us from drifting into generic self-help.

9. Step 8: Final Delivery Checklist
Before you hand to editors / client, the employee should check:
Every script is in 2-column layout


“Key Information” block at top


Real IG inspiration link (or close)


No emojis


No dashes in dialogue


Length ≈ 1:00–1:30


Ties back to offers (quiz, challenge, cohorts) at least every 3–4 videos


Filming instructions are on the left, dialogue on the right



10. Quick Master Prompt (Employee Version)
You can paste this at the top of any new client thread:
“We build social scripts in a very specific format. All scripts must be in two columns with ‘NOTES AND B-ROLL’ on the left and ‘SCRIPT’ on the right. Always include a ‘Key Information’ section at the top (Video Format, Inspiration Video with real IG link, Subtopic, Instructions).
Cross reference:
this onboarding doc: [PASTE]


these market comps: [PASTE]


First, give me a monthly content ratio (12 videos) broken out by style. Then for each style, give me 5–10 ideas. I will pick and you will write the script in the 2-column format.
 No emojis. No dashes in dialogue. Keep it around 1:15.”
That’s the whole system.
If you want I can turn this into a “Day 1 employee training” version with example prompts filled in for Daily Courage and Lifetime Insurance side-by-side.
